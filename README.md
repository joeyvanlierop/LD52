### Welcome to the Fields of Fortune!

...the exciting new card game where you’ll plant and harvest crops to earn points and outwit your opponents. In this farm-paced game, you’ll have to use strategy and quick thinking to maximize your crops and claim the most valuable tiles on the field.

Each turn, you’ll have three action points to use on planting, harvesting, and playing special cards. Plant purple corn and water gourd crops to and watch them grow each turn! Use action cards like Sabotage and Steal to mess with your opponents’ fields and shoot yourself closer to victory! Use Terraform cards to remove obstacles and claim new tiles! And most importantly, play Harvest cards on your fully grown plants to reap the rewards of your hard work and claim victory! Don’t forget to use Fertilizer to speed up the growth of your crops.

The game ends when there are no more cards to draw, and the player with the most points wins. Will you be the master of the harvest? Try your hand at Field of Fortune and find out!
